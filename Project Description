The purpose of the project is to implement a multimodal trip planner and incorporate multi criterion optimization algorithms
in the application. This trip planner provides a simple user interface, where user can enter their source city, destination 
city followed by set of preferences like AC/Non-AC, Sleeper or Recliner, cost over time or time over cost. These preferences 
will be analyzed by a program running on the server side using the implemented standard multicriterion algorithms to return 
the best package according to user's preferences.
